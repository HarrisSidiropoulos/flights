#Find cheap Flights & weather
Build a tool (website/mobile app/etc) where a user can input up to 5 destinations, a date within the next 14 days and their current location that will then lookup and display weather forecasts for the locations/dates (http://openweathermap.org/) as well as the cheapest flight price (https://developers.google.com/qpx-express/).
